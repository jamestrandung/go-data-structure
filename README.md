# go-data-structure

Before Go 1.18, there was no `generic`. As a consequence, it was impossible to create generic implementations for popular
data structures such as Set or Concurrent Map.

This package aims to leverage the newly introduced `generic` capability in Go to provide the popular data structures
in other languages using generic implementations that can be utilized in any projects.

Clients can take a look at the `README.md` from each package to understand what it's meant for.
