# go-data-structure

Using the newly introduced `generic` capabilities in Go 1.18, this package aims to provide the popular data structures
in other languages with exhaustive unit tests and benchmark suites.

Clients can take a look at the `README.md` from each package to understand what it's meant for.

## Guidelines for contributing

Contributions are highly welcome! In order for a contribution to be merged, please follow these guidelines:
- Open an issue and describe what you're offering (e.g. fixing a bug, adding an enhancement, etc.).
- Submit a pull request with clear description of the changes and a link to the above issue after getting feedbacks
from the core team.
- New code must have unit tests and, if required by the core team, benchmark tests.
- If the new code aims to fix performance issues, you must include benchmarks in the process (either in the issue or 
in the pull request).
- In general, we'd like to keep our code as simple and as similar as possible to the native `map`. Please keep this in 
mind when opening issues.
